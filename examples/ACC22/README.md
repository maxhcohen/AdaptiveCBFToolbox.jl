M. H. Cohen and C. Belta, "High Order Robust Adaptive Control Barrier Functions and Exponentially Stabilizing Adaptive Control Lyapunov Functions," in Proceedings of the American Control Conference, pp. 2233 - 2238, 2022.

The file `double_integrator.jl` allows for reproducing the simulation results involving the double integrator by changing the bounds on the uncertain parameters. The files `inverted_pendulum_clf.jl` and `inverted_pendulum_cbf.jl` allows for reproducing the simulations involving the inverted pendulum. The figures that appear in the paper were generated by saving the data from these simulations and then plotting said data using Tikz/PGFPlots (I highly recommend such a workflow for anyone making plots for scientific publications). If you find this code useful, consider citing our paper:
