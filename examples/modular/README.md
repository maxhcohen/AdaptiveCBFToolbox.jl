# What's in this folder?
The scripts in this folder can be used to reproduce the simulation results reported in

M. H. Cohen and C. Belta, "Modular Adaptive Safety-Critical Control," under review.

The file `modular_sims.jl` allows for reproducing the simulation results comparing the performance of the different parameter estimation routines used in the paper. The other simulation results can be reproduced by running the scripts titled `gradient_theta.jl` and `rls_theta.jl`. The other scripts in this folder provide the ability to run a single simulation using the various parameter estimators used in the paper. Running these simulations will produce plots that closely replicate those in the paper; however, the actual plots in the paper were generated by exporting the simulation figures as a Tikz file using `Plots.jl` and `PGFPlotsX.jl`, which were then fine tuned directly in LaTeX using PGFPlots.
